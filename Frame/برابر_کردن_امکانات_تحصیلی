|Description=Creating an educational system based on equal opportunities
|Comments=No corresponding English frame found. The Persian frame was formerly linked to the frame "Educational opportunities" in the English Wiki. The compound verb makes the frame too long. Incidentally, tehere exists the same frame, but without the element "equalizing" in Persian Wiki. comment by Reza
 The compound verb 'barabar' (equal, or even) 'kardan' (to do or make) is relatively new and in this context alludes to educational egalitarianism. However, I was not able to find this verb used in the context of education at least on Google. comment by Aria Fani
