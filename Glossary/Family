|Description=Each frame can (optionally) be specified to be a member of one or more Frame families.  Similarly, each metaphor is (optionally) defined to be a member of one or more Metaphor families.

Families are used to group related frames/metaphors together, e.g. for ease of analyzing a particular semantic domain or set of metaphors.    

Lists of Frame Families and Metaphor Families can be accessed via links listed under the Metaphor Data Guide section of the Main page of the Wiki. 
Clicking on a given family name provides access to a list of the frames/metaphors that have been specified to be members of that family, as well as a diagram that illustrates the defined relations between these  frames/metaphors.  For frame families, there is also a list of the LUs associated with each of the frames.
