|Entry=Closest FrameNet Frames
|Description=This is an optional field in the wiki Frame page that provides a live link to one or more FrameNet frames.   In order for this link to work, the name listed must match that of an existing FrameNet frame.  

When a FrameNet frame is specified within a frame, equivalent FrameNet roles (FE's, in FrameNet terminology) may be specified for the roles defined in the 'Roles' section of the frame. These specifications require manual entry. See [[Role]].

Additionally, there will be an automatically-added entry in the 'Lexical Units in Related Frames' section of the frame, indicating which lexical units are currently listed in the closest FrameNet frame(s).
