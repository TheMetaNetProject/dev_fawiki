|Entry=Composed Metaphor
|Other Aliases=Complex Metaphor
|Description=A composed or complex metaphor has bindings to multiple, more general metaphors. Typically it is a source or target subcase of at least one metaphor, in which case either its source or target domain is a subcase of the source or target of the related metaphor.
Composed metaphors bind fully to one or more metaphors which they are subcases of. Complex metaphors bind fully to at least one metaphor, but are also related to other metaphors without binding all of their roles to the roles of that metaphor.
