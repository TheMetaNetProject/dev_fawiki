|Description=When talking about metaphors, we use the term 'map' to refer to the correspondence between frames or domains as opposed to the correspondence between their frame elements (which is referred to as 'mappings'). For instance ARGUMENT IS WAR is a metaphor map, and 'words are weapons' would be one of its many mappings. The metaphor receives a name in the TARGET IS SOURCE format, where the terms chosen for the TARGET and SOURCE in that particular metaphor name are maximally informative of the metaphor itself, rather than of its entailments or mappings.
