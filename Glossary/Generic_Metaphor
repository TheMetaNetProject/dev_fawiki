|Entry=Generic Metaphor
|Other Aliases=General metaphor; Higher metaphor; Domain-level metaphor
|Description=This is the most generic level metaphor, and it often does not come in a TARGET IS SOURCE format in the literature. How we treat these from now on is still being debated, but we are thinking it's best perhaps that these are their own metaphors with their own roles, and of which other metaphors are instances. For instance MIND IS BODY is a higher/generic/domain-level metaphor and has instances such as SENSING IS SMELLING, etc. Other ways to treat these metaphors are: they are supermetaphors that define domains, they are generalizations over other metaphors and they are not basic embodied metaphors in and of themselves. In category terms, they are superordinate and not basic level.
