|Entry=Inference
|Description=The detailed knowledge about a frame or frame that constitutes the internal logic of that frame or frame by which we reason about that frame or frame; inferences fall out from our understanding of a frame or frame given the constraints on that frame or frame. Traditionally, inference and entailment are synonymous. In the Wiki, inference is kept to refer to the internal logic of a frame or frame, while entailment is used to refer to the corresponding logic in the target domain in a metaphoric mapping.
