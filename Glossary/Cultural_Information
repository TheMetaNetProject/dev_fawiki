|Description=If a frame happens to be a frame, this means that the frame has some socio-cultural meanings that may vary. The 'Cultural information' field is meant to provide a space to elaborate on possible relevant socio-cultural aspects of that frame, especially those aspects that may prove to be most variable cross-linguistically.
If the cultural scope for a frame has been determined, it will be noted here.
