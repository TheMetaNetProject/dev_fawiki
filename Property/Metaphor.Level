<p>
Specific-level metaphors occupy a low level on a scale of generality on which conceptual metaphors can be placed. They are composed of specifi c-level source and target domains. Specific-level metaphors are instantiations, or special cases, of generic-level ones. Thus, the metaphor ANGER IS A HOT FLUID IN A CONTAINER is an instantiation, or special case, of the generic-level metaphor EMOTIONS ARE FORCES.
