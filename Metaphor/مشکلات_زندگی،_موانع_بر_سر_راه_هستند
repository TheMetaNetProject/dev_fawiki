This is a different metaphor than English metaphor DIFFICULTIES IN PROGRESSING THROUGH LIFE ARE IMPEDIMENTS TO MOTION ALONG A PATH as it does not necessarily imply making progress but as the example shows it can be just a return to normal condition ( primary location
) 
POSHTE SAR GOZASHTAN = back head put.infin is not about putting an object behind head. It is about the person's directional view. AS the person moves along the path by changing from illness state to the healthiness , Every thing in the previous location remains in the same location and is viewed as if it is in back of the person's head. PUT has a different frame than GOZASHTAN. It can also mean to let something be or remain in the same lozation.
BOGZAR HAMINJA BASHAD: Put.Optative mood here be.preset.Imperative The translation would be Let's it be there or let the object that is previously there stay in the same place(don't move it)
