|Comments=Weak or dysfunctional democracy is characterized as watery in Persian for liquids take the shape of things around them and have no foundation or substance. The implication is that democracy, as a governing system, needs to be founded upon a solid foundation (social justice, political liberties, etc) and that is why a weak democracy behaves the way liquids do: taking the shape of whatever system exists in society, whether applied to a social system of economic disparity or economic egaliteranism; it takes their shape. "Watery" is used to describe other things as well, implying that they are void of value, substance, or importance. For instance "Your joke was watery" or "This film was watery. Here it implies the film's narrative was not substantial or the joke lacked content. ."
