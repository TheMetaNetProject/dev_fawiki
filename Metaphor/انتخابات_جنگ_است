|Comments=This metaphor needs to be justified as far as its use in Persian letters goes.The example provided is misconstrued and does not support the metaphor of "Election is War." The example reads: "The electoral campaign of 'the resistance front' will begin working in Tehran. Jibhah-i muqavimat [resistance front] is the name of a campaign, reflective of the political party it supports. It does not discuss elections in the context of war. Please advise
